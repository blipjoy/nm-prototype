Game Information
----------------

Rachel is 15 years old. She grew up hearing stories of a strange island called
"Neverwell", told by her grandfather ("Papa" to Rachel). Rachel was 5 at the
time, and the stories were always something adventurous and entertaining. Papa
would tell her about the inhabitants of the island, and how they could perform
magic. He would fight monsters while hunting for treasures buried in deep caves.
There were so many details in his stories that he had to set some of his
adventures on smaller islands around Neverwell.

Papa died shortly after, and it's been 10 years, so she doesn't remember all of
the stories he told. But she remembers important details like the eponymous
moor, which was a very dangerous place, but that it held some kind of secret...
Perhaps the secret to the inhabitants magic? But that was a long time ago, and
they were just stories. Everyone knows there is only one island, and they call
it "Earth."

So Rachel sets off on a day like any other, but, feeling a little adventurous,
she decides to help a friend. That kind gesture leads to a series of quests
which eventually lands Rachel on Neverwell; a place that isn't supposed to
exist...
